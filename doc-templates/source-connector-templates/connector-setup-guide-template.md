{This is a connector setup guide template. Items between curly brackets need to be replaced with specific names or directions. For links to Fivetran documentation pages/sections, do _not_ use the absolute path format like [page name](https://fivetran.com/docs/...), use [page/section name](/docs/...) instead. Also, do _not_ include `/index.md` in the path, trim the path at the page directory. For example,  [connector page name](/docs/connectors/applications/some-connector) is correct while [connector page name](/docs/connectors/applications/some-connector/index.md) is _incorrect_.}
